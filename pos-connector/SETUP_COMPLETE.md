# ✅ Aronium POS Integration Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Your system is now ready to automatically process Aronium PDF invoices!

### How It Works:

1. **Manual Export from Aronium**: You export invoices as PDF files from Aronium POS
2. **Automatic Detection**: The connector watches the folder `C:\Aronium\Invoices\` for new PDF files
3. **PDF Processing**: When you save a PDF, the system automatically:
   - Extracts transaction data from the PDF using OCR and text parsing
   - Converts the data to Laravel invoice format
   - Creates an invoice in your JoFotara system
   - Moves the processed PDF to `C:\Aronium\Invoices\Processed\`

### 🚀 How to Use:

#### Step 1: Start the Connector
```bash
cd c:/xampp/htdocs/jo-invoicing/pos-connector
python main.py
```
OR double-click: `start_aronium_connector.bat`

#### Step 2: Export from Aronium
1. Complete a sale in Aronium POS
2. Export/Print the invoice as PDF
3. Save it to: `C:\Aronium\Invoices\`

#### Step 3: Automatic Processing
- The connector will immediately detect the new PDF
- Extract all transaction data (customer, items, totals, etc.)
- Create an invoice in your Laravel system
- Move the PDF to the "Processed" folder

### 📁 Folder Structure:
```
C:\Aronium\Invoices\          ← Save your PDF exports here
C:\Aronium\Invoices\Processed\ ← Processed files go here automatically
```

### 🔧 Configuration:
- **Mode**: File monitoring (detection_mode: "2")
- **Watch Folder**: `C:\Aronium\Invoices\`
- **Check Interval**: Every 30 seconds
- **Supported Files**: PDF and JSON

### 📊 What Gets Extracted from PDFs:
- Transaction ID/Invoice Number
- Date and Time
- Customer Information (name, phone, email)
- Line Items (description, quantity, price)
- Subtotal, Tax, and Total amounts
- Payment Method

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

#### If invoices aren't being processed:
1. Check that the PDF is saved in the correct folder: `C:\Aronium\Invoices\`
2. Verify the connector is running (you should see "Watching..." message)
3. Check logs in: `logs/enhanced_connector.log`
4. Make sure your Laravel system is running

#### If PDF parsing fails:
- The system will log detailed error messages
- Check that the PDF contains readable text (not just images)
- Verify the PDF format matches expected Aronium layout

### 📝 Log Files:
- Main log: `logs/enhanced_connector.log`
- Contains detailed information about processing, errors, and API calls

### 🔄 Current Configuration:
- **Laravel API**: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **Email**: malikqattom@gmail.com
- **Auto-submit to JoFotara**: Disabled (you can enable this later)

### 🎯 Success Indicators:
When working correctly, you'll see:
```
New invoice detected: invoice_001.pdf
Processing PDF invoice: invoice_001.pdf
Creating invoice in Laravel system...
Successfully processed invoice: 123
