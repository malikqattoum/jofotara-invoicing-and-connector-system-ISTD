# POS Data Mapping Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Parsing Error
**Problem**: The `test_invoice.json` file contained multiple JSON objects concatenated together without proper array syntax, causing "Extra data: line 21 column 2" error.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the JSON file to contain a single valid JSON object
- Enhanced error handling in `test_json_mapping.py` to provide better diagnostics for JSON parsing issues

### 2. Mapping Logic Errors
**Problem**: The mapping logic was trying to access dictionary keys that didn't exist for specific POS system mappings, causing KeyError exceptions.

**Solution**:
- Updated all mapping field access to use `.get()` method with empty list defaults
- Added comprehensive mappings for QuickBooks and minimal format POS systems
- Enhanced POS system detection logic

### 3. Missing POS Format Support
**Problem**: Limited support for different POS system formats.

**Solution**:
- Added QuickBooks format mapping with proper field mappings
- Added minimal format mapping for simple POS systems
- Enhanced item mapping logic to handle different data structures

## Files Modified

1. **pos_connector/pos_data_mapping.py**
   - Fixed mapping field access using `.get()` method
   - Added QuickBooks and minimal format mappings
   - Enhanced POS system detection
   - Improved item mapping logic

2. **test_json_mapping.py**
   - Enhanced JSON parsing error handling
   - Added better error diagnostics

3. **C:/TestPOS/Invoices/test_invoice.json**
   - Fixed JSON syntax by removing duplicate objects

## New Test Files Created

1. **test_multiple_formats.py** - Comprehensive testing for multiple POS formats
2. **test_data/** directory with sample files for different POS systems

## Test Results

✅ **Original JSON mapping test**: PASSED
✅ **Generic POS format**: PASSED  
✅ **QuickBooks format**: PASSED
✅ **Minimal format**: PASSED

All POS data mapping tests are now working correctly with proper error handling and support for multiple POS system formats.

## Usage

```bash
# Test single JSON file
python test_json_mapping.py

# Test multiple POS formats
python test_multiple_formats.py
```

Both tests now pass successfully with proper data mapping from various POS formats to Laravel API format.
