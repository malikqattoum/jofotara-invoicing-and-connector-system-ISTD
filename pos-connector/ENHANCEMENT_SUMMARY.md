# üéØ POS Connector Enhancement Summary

## üìã Issues Resolved

### **1. User Choice for Folder Configuration**
**Problem**: Users were forced into automatic detection without choice
**Solution**: Added user choice in setup wizard
```
Choose how to configure the invoice folder:
1. Automatic detection (recommended)
2. Manual folder selection
```

### **2. Filename Display in Transaction Processing**
**Problem**: Generic messages didn't show which files were processed
**Solution**: Enhanced messages with filename information
```
‚úÖ Successfully sent transaction from file: invoice_001.json
üìÑ Successfully processed invoice 12345 from file: invoice_001.json
```

### **3. Installation "File in Use" Error**
**Problem**: Installer failed when connector was running
**Solution**: Enhanced installer with automatic process management
- Detects running processes
- Safely stops them before installation
- Prevents "file in use" errors
