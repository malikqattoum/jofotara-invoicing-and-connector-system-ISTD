# üìÅ Dynamic Invoice Folder Detection

## Overview

The JoFotara POS Connector now includes **Dynamic Invoice Folder Detection** that automatically discovers and monitors POS invoice export folders without requiring manual configuration for each customer deployment.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

### Before (Manual Setup)
- ‚ùå Required manual folder configuration for each customer
- ‚ùå Customers had to know exact POS export folder paths
- ‚ùå Setup errors if wrong folder specified
- ‚ùå No monitoring of multiple folders

### After (Dynamic Detection)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic folder discovery** - finds POS folders automatically
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- ‚úÖ **Multi-folder monitoring** - monitors multiple active folders
- ‚úÖ **Smart prioritization** - focuses on folders with recent activity
- ‚úÖ **Universal compatibility** - works with any POS system

## üîç How It Works

### Detection Methods

The system uses multiple discovery methods to find invoice folders:

1. **Pattern Matching**
   - Scans common POS installation directories
   - Looks for known POS system folder structures
   - Supports 20+ popular POS systems (Aronium, Square, Shopify, etc.)

2. **Recent File Analysis**
   - Finds folders with recently modified invoice files
   - Analyzes file types (PDF, JSON, XML, CSV)
   - Prioritizes folders with recent activity

3. **Registry Scanning**
   - Checks Windows registry for POS software data paths
   - Discovers configured export locations
   - Finds user-specific document folders

4. **Common Location Search**
   - Scans typical business software locations
   - Checks user Documents and Desktop folders
   - Looks for generic business/invoice folders

### Scoring System

Each discovered folder gets a priority score based on:
- **File Count**: More files = higher score
- **Recent Activity**: Recent files boost score significantly
- **File Types**: PDF and JSON files get bonus points
- **POS System**: Known POS systems get priority over generic folders
- **Folder Age**: Newer folders with activity score higher

## üéØ Detection Modes

### Mode 1: Enhanced Automatic (Recommended)
```json
{
    "detection_mode": "1",
    "auto_detect_folders": true
}
```
- Automatically discovers POS systems AND invoice folders
- Monitors multiple folders simultaneously
- Best for most deployments

### Mode 2: File Monitoring with User Choice
```json
{
    "detection_mode": "2"
}
```
During setup, users choose:
1. **Automatic detection** - system scans and suggests folders
2. **Manual selection** - user specifies custom folder path

This gives users full control while still offering automatic assistance.

### Mode 2: Legacy Manual
```json
{
    "detection_mode": "2",
    "auto_detect_folders": false,
    "invoice_folder": "C:\\Custom\\Path"
}
```
- Traditional manual folder specification
- Still supported for special cases

## üìã Setup Examples

### Automatic Setup (Zero Configuration)
```bash
# Just run the connector - it finds folders automatically
python main.py
```

### Interactive Setup with User Choice
```bash
# Run setup wizard with enhanced options
python main.py --setup
```

The setup wizard will show:
```
--- Invoice Folder Configuration ---
Choose how to configure the invoice folder:
1. Automatic detection (recommended)
2. Manual folder selection

Choose option (1/2) [1]: 1

üîç Scanning for POS invoice folders...

üìÅ Found 3 potential invoice folders:
============================================================
 1. C:\Aronium\Invoices
    POS System: aronium
    Files: 45 total, 12 recent
    Score: 67.5

 2. C:\Users\John\Documents\POS
    POS System: discovered
    Files: 23 total, 8 recent
    Score: 34.2

 3. C:\Business\Invoices
    POS System: generic
    Files: 156 total, 3 recent
    Score: 28.1

Select folder number (1-3) or 'c' for custom path: 1
‚úÖ Using automatically detected folder: C:\Aronium\Invoices
```

## üìÑ Enhanced Transaction Processing

### Filename Display
When transactions are processed, you'll see detailed information including the source filename:

```
üìÑ New invoice detected: invoice_001.json
üìÅ Source folder: C:\Aronium\Invoices (POS: aronium)
üîÑ Creating invoice in Laravel system from invoice_001.json...
üì§ Submitting invoice 12345 to JoFotara from invoice_001.json...
‚úÖ Successfully sent transaction from file: invoice_001.json
üìÑ Successfully processed invoice 12345 from file: invoice_001.json
üìÅ Processed file moved to: C:\Aronium\Invoices\Processed
```

This makes it easy to:
- Track which files are being processed
- Identify the source of each transaction
- Debug processing issues
- Monitor folder activity

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### New Configuration Keys

```json
{
    "auto_detect_folders": true,        // Enable automatic detection
    "max_monitored_folders": 5,         // Maximum folders to monitor
    "min_folder_score": 10.0,          // Minimum score to monitor folder
    "folder_scan_depth": 3,            // Directory scan depth limit
    "quick_discovery": false           // Fast discovery mode only
}
```

### Supported POS Systems

The detector recognizes these POS systems:
- **Aronium POS**
- **Square POS**
- **Shopify POS**
- **QuickBooks POS**
- **Sage POS**
- **NCR Aloha**
- **Oracle Micros**
- **Toast POS**
- **Lightspeed**
- **Revel Systems**
- **Clover**
- **Generic POS systems**

## üß™ Testing

### Test the Detection
```bash
# Test folder detection
python test_folder_detection.py

# Create test folders for demonstration
python test_folder_detection.py create-test

# Clean up test folders
python test_folder_detection.py cleanup
```

### Manual Testing
```python
from pos_connector.folder_detector import InvoiceFolderDetector

detector = InvoiceFolderDetector()
folders = detector.detect_invoice_folders()
best_folder = detector.get_best_folder()

print(f"Found {len(folders)} folders")
print(f"Best folder: {best_folder}")
```

## üìä Monitoring Status

Check monitoring status:
```python
# In enhanced mode (detection_mode = "1")
connector = EnhancedPOSConnector(config)
status = connector.get_status()

print(f"Discovered systems: {status['discovered_systems']}")
print(f"Monitored folders: {status['monitored_folders']}")
print(f"Active monitors: {status['active_monitors']}")
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Folders Detected
```bash
# Check if POS software is installed
# Verify invoice files exist in expected locations
# Run with debug logging
python main.py --setup
# Set log_level to "DEBUG"
```

### Wrong Folder Detected
```bash
# Use interactive setup to choose correct folder
python main.py --setup
# Choose detection_mode "2"
# Select correct folder from suggestions or specify custom path
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Enable quick discovery mode
# Edit config.json:
{
    "quick_discovery": true,
    "max_monitored_folders": 2
}
```

## üîÑ Migration from Manual Setup

### Existing Deployments
1. Update connector to latest version
2. Set `"auto_detect_folders": true` in config.json
3. Optionally change `"detection_mode"` to `"1"`
4. Restart connector - it will automatically discover folders

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing manual configurations continue to work
- `invoice_folder` setting is still respected
- No breaking changes to existing deployments

## üìù Best Practices

### For New Deployments
1. Use detection mode "1" (enhanced automatic)
2. Enable `auto_detect_folders`
3. Let the system discover folders automatically
4. Monitor logs for detected folders

### For Existing Customers
1. Test detection in development environment first
2. Keep existing `invoice_folder` as fallback
3. Gradually migrate to automatic detection
4. Monitor performance and adjust settings

### For Multiple POS Systems
1. The connector automatically handles multiple systems
2. Each folder is monitored independently
3. Scoring system prioritizes active folders
4. Configure `max_monitored_folders` based on system resources

## üéâ Summary

Dynamic Invoice Folder Detection transforms the POS connector from a manual configuration tool to an intelligent, self-configuring system that works out of the box with any POS system. This dramatically reduces deployment time, eliminates configuration errors, and provides a better experience for both integrators and end customers.

The system is backward compatible, so existing deployments continue to work while new deployments benefit from zero-configuration automatic detection.
